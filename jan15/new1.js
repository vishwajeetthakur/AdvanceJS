// if js is compiled 
// hello man should be printed, but due to error in console..log(),
// the program will not even execute

// CONCLUSION js is not purely intrepeted 
// there is something reading the code and doing some analysis 


console.log("hello man")

function fun(){
    console..log("here is the fucntion")
}

console.log("second line before fucn")
fun()
console.log("end")
